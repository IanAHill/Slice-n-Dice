## What is this application?
This application is a virtual family recipe cookbook that stores all your relatives' homemade recipes from over the years allowing them to be at your fingertips.
#
## What does the application do?
This application organizes your family's homemade recipes by storing and saving the recipes for the family to have access to them later. The application is logged in based so only certain users have access to their family's cookbook.
#
## Why was this application made?
This application was created to help users have their family's recipes at the touch of their fingertips without having the hassle of having to call extended family. The app works by collecting and organizing all the user's family's homemade recipes allowing other relatives to have access to them too.
#
## How do users use it?
Users can login or sign up to access their family cookbook account where they're presented categories of food allowing them to navigate and browse through recipes.
#
## What problem does it solve?
Homemade family recipes are special and irreplaceable, and if you were to lose or misplace a recipe you won't have any way to get a new one. You would have to reach out to extended family to retrieve those recipes. To avoid many phone calls to relatives or having to rely on one piece of paper, you can use the Family Cookbook to store and organize your family's recipes for you and family members to access later.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
